BILLING PAGES TEST SUMMARY - 2025-10-21
================================================================================

PROJECT: AdNexus DSP
ENVIRONMENT: localhost:4000 (Rails Development)
TESTER: Automated Playwright Tests
STATUS: ✅ BOTH ISSUES TESTED AND FIXED

================================================================================
QUICK REFERENCE
================================================================================

Issue 1: Manage Payment Methods (/subscriptions)
  Status: ✅ WORKING (No changes needed)
  Flow: Link → /subscriptions/portal → Stripe Customer Portal
  Result: Successful redirect

Issue 2: Purchase Credits (/credits)
  Status: ✅ FIXED (Applied 1-line change)
  Flow: Form → /credits POST → Stripe Checkout
  Problem: CORS error due to Turbo fetch interception
  Solution: Added data: { turbo: false } to form_with
  Result: Successful redirect after fix

================================================================================
DETAILED FINDINGS
================================================================================

TEST 1: MANAGE PAYMENT METHODS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Location: http://localhost:4000/subscriptions
Button: "Manage Payment Methods" in Payment Methods card
Controller: SubscriptionsController#portal
Route: GET /subscriptions/portal

Before Click:
  - Page displays at /subscriptions
  - Button shows settings icon with external link indicator
  - Href: http://localhost:4000/subscriptions/portal

After Click:
  - URL redirects to Stripe Customer Portal
  - No console errors
  - User can manage payment methods and subscriptions

Result: ✅ PASS - Works as expected


TEST 2: PURCHASE CREDITS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Location: http://localhost:4000/credits
Form: "Add Credits" card with amount input
Controller: CreditsController#create
Route: POST /credits

INITIAL TEST (Before Fix):
  - URL entered: "25"
  - Button clicked: "Purchase Credits"
  
  BEFORE CLICK:
    - Page at /credits
    - Amount field shows "$25.00"
    - Button enabled and visible
  
  AFTER CLICK:
    - Page stayed at /credits (NO redirect)
    - Button showed loading state
    - Console error: CORS policy violation
      "Access to fetch at 'https://pay.ad.nexus/c/pay/cs_live_...' 
       has been blocked by CORS policy"
    - Additional errors: TypeError: Failed to fetch
  
  Root Cause: 
    - Form uses form_with (default Turbo interception)
    - Turbo uses fetch instead of standard form submission
    - Fetch is subject to CORS restrictions
    - Stripe domain doesn't include CORS headers for localhost
  
  Result: ❌ FAIL - CORS error blocks redirect

AFTER FIX (Applied turbo: false):
  - Amount entered: "25"
  - Button clicked: "Purchase Credits"
  
  CHANGE APPLIED:
    File: app/views/credits/index.html.erb
    Line: 83
    Added: local: true, data: { turbo: false }
  
  AFTER CLICK:
    - Page redirected to Stripe Checkout
    - URL: https://pay.ad.nexus/c/pay/cs_live_...
    - Stripe payment form loaded with:
      * Email field (pre-filled from account)
      * Card information section
      * Cardholder name field
      * Country selector
      * ZIP code field
      * "Pay" button
    - Minor console warning (expected):
      "Failed to download Google Pay manifest"
      (This is from Stripe/Google Pay, not our app)
  
  Result: ✅ PASS - Successfully redirects to Stripe Checkout

================================================================================
CODE CHANGES
================================================================================

SINGLE FILE MODIFIED:
  File: /Users/z/work/adnexus/dsp/app/views/credits/index.html.erb
  Line: 83
  
  BEFORE:
    <%= form_with url: credits_path, method: :post, id: 'credits-form', class: 'space-y-5' do |f| %>
  
  AFTER:
    <%= form_with url: credits_path, method: :post, id: 'credits-form', class: 'space-y-5', local: true, data: { turbo: false } do |f| %>
  
  WHAT IT DOES:
    - local: true → Use standard form_with helper
    - data: { turbo: false } → Disable Turbo/Hotwire interception
    - Result: Browser performs standard form submission (not fetch)
    - Benefit: Top-level navigation bypasses CORS restrictions

IMPACT:
  - 1 line changed
  - 0 migrations needed
  - 0 controller changes
  - No breaking changes
  - Backward compatible

================================================================================
TEST METHODOLOGY
================================================================================

Testing Tool: Playwright (Node.js browser automation)
Script: test-billing-issues.js
Steps per issue:

  7. Check console for errors
  8. Verify URL and page content

Test Coverage:
  ✓ Navigation
  ✓ UI element visibility
  ✓ Button functionality
  ✓ Form submission
  ✓ Redirect behavior
  ✓ Console error detection
  ✓ URL verification
  ✓ Page content verification

SCREENSHOTS CAPTURED
================================================================================

Location: /tmp/billing-test-screenshots/

01-subscriptions-before.png

================================================================================
KEY INSIGHTS
================================================================================

Why Issue 1 Works:
  - Uses link_to helper (standard <a> tag)
  - Browser navigates to /subscriptions/portal endpoint
  - Controller creates Stripe session and redirects
  - Top-level navigation (not fetch) to Stripe
  - CORS policies don't apply to top-level navigation
  - ✅ No issues

Why Issue 2 Was Broken:
  - Uses form_with helper (intercepted by Turbo)
  - Turbo converts form submission to fetch request
  - fetch is subject to CORS restrictions
  - Stripe domain lacks CORS headers for localhost:4000
  - Browser blocks the fetch request
  - ❌ CORS error

How Fix Resolves It:
  - Disables Turbo form interception with data: { turbo: false }
  - Browser performs standard HTML form submission
  - POST sent via standard protocol (not fetch)
  - Server redirects to Stripe URL
  - Browser performs top-level navigation
  - CORS policies don't apply
  - ✅ Works correctly

DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
================================================================================

To deploy this fix:

[ ] Read BILLING_TEST_REPORT.md for detailed technical analysis
[ ] Read BILLING_TEST_RESULTS_AFTER_FIX.md for fix details
[ ] Review the changed line in app/views/credits/index.html.erb
[ ] Restart Rails server (rails s)
[ ] Test in browser: http://localhost:4000/credits
[ ] Enter amount and click "Purchase Credits"
[ ] Verify redirect to Stripe Checkout
[ ] Check browser console for no CORS errors
[ ] Run any existing integration tests
[ ] Deploy to staging environment
[ ] Run user acceptance testing
[ ] Deploy to production
[ ] Monitor for checkout errors in logs

Risk Assessment: LOW
- Single line change
- No database modifications
- No controller changes
- Standard Rails pattern
- Well-documented solution

================================================================================
FOLLOW-UP RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

Immediate:
  1. Deploy fix to production
  2. Monitor checkout completion rates
  3. Watch for any payment-related errors in logs

Short-term (1-2 weeks):
  1. Add integration tests for Stripe redirects
  2. Document payment flow in wiki/docs
  3. Review other forms using form_with for similar issues
  4. Update deployment runbook if needed

Medium-term (1-2 months):
  1. Consider implementing email confirmations for payments
  2. Add webhook monitoring for failed payments
  3. Implement retry logic for failed Stripe calls
  4. Add comprehensive payment error handling
