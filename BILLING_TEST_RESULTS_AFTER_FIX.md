## Issue 2: Purchase Credits - FIXED

### Applied Fix

**File:** `/Users/z/work/adnexus/dsp/app/views/credits/index.html.erb`  
**Line:** 83

**Before:**
```erb
<%= form_with url: credits_path, method: :post, id: 'credits-form', class: 'space-y-5' do |f| %>
```

**After:**
```erb
<%= form_with url: credits_path, method: :post, id: 'credits-form', class: 'space-y-5', local: true, data: { turbo: false } do |f| %>
```

### What Changed

Added two options to the form:
- `local: true` - Renders as a regular form helper
- `data: { turbo: false }` - Disables Turbo interception

### Why This Works

By disabling Turbo, the browser now performs a **standard form submission** instead of using `fetch`:

1. User clicks "Purchase Credits" button
2. Browser submits form via HTTP POST (no fetch)
3. Server creates Stripe session
4. Server redirects to Stripe Checkout URL
5. **Top-level navigation** (not subject to CORS)
6. User successfully lands on Stripe payment page

### Test Results After Fix

```
[2.6] Clicking purchase button...
URL before: http://localhost:4000/credits
URL after: https://pay.ad.nexus/c/pay/cs_live_a1Y9lVcaC6hxKeAldVrXJ7zilwiL0kgscq9BeTXiO64E4b2G3RahA4ty1K#...
Redirected to Stripe: true (URL changed to Stripe domain)

[2.9] Checking page content...
Page title: Adnexus Technology, Inc.
Current URL: https://pay.ad.nexus/c/pay/... (Stripe Checkout)
```

### Console Errors After Fix

```
✗ Console Error: Failed to download or decode a non-empty icon for payment app with "https://pay.google.com/gp/p/web_manifest.json" manifest.
```

This error is **EXPECTED and HARMLESS** - it's from Google Pay trying to load its manifest. This is a Stripe/Google Pay issue, not a problem with our application. The payment form still loads and functions correctly.

### Screenshot After Fix

The screenshot shows the **Stripe Checkout payment form** has loaded successfully:
- Contact information section (email pre-filled)
- Payment method card form
- Card holder name field
- Country/region selector
- ZIP code field
- "Pay" button
- Stripe powered footer

This confirms the redirect to Stripe Checkout is working correctly.

## Deployment Instructions

### To Apply This Fix

1. **Update the view file:**
   ```bash
   # File: app/views/credits/index.html.erb, line 83
   # Change: Add local: true, data: { turbo: false } to form_with
   ```

2. **Restart Rails server:**
   ```bash
   rails s
   ```

3. **Test in browser:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:4000/credits
   - Enter amount (e.g., 25)
   - Click "Purchase Credits"
   - Verify redirect to Stripe Checkout

### No Database Changes Required
- No migrations needed
- No controller changes needed
- Only view template change

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ User experience improved

## Recommendations for Code Review

1. **Minor:** Consider applying the same fix to any other payment forms using `form_with`
2. **Best Practice:** Document why `turbo: false` is used in the form comment
3. **Testing:** Add integration test to verify Stripe redirect flow
4. **Monitoring:** Track checkout abandonment due to technical errors

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/z/work/adnexus/dsp/app/views/credits/index.html.erb` - Added Turbo disable option

## Files Not Modified

- `app/controllers/credits_controller.rb` - No changes needed
- `config/routes.rb` - No changes needed
- All other files - No changes needed

## Test Screenshots

- **03-credits-before.png** - Credits page before clicking
- **04-credits-after.png** - Stripe Checkout page after fix

---

## Conclusion

The CORS issue has been successfully fixed by disabling Turbo form interception. The application now properly redirects users to the Stripe Checkout payment form, allowing them to purchase credits seamlessly.

Both billing features are now **fully functional**:
1. ✅ Manage Payment Methods → Stripe Customer Portal
2. ✅ Purchase Credits → Stripe Checkout

The fix is minimal, non-breaking, and follows Rails best practices for handling external redirects.
