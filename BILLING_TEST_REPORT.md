4. Waited 5 seconds

#### Results

**Before Click:**
- Page displays wallet/credits dashboard at `/credits`
- Amount field shows "$25.00"
- "Purchase Credits" button is visible and enabled

**After Click:**
- Page stays at `/credits` (NO redirect to Stripe)
- Button shows loading state: "Redirecting to Stripe..." with spinner
- ❌ **CORS Error** in browser console:
  ```
  Access to fetch at 'https://pay.ad.nexus/c/pay/cs_live_a11Ibh4eDtuDqfln5WPh1fFhZEkpqyak6ZWDHEHZ8F6vgunBYvbBcZ2UkV#...' 
  (redirected from 'http://localhost:4000/credits') from origin 'http://localhost:4000' 
  has been blocked by CORS policy: Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: 
  No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
  ```
- Additional console errors:
  - `Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FAILED`
  - `TypeError: Failed to fetch`

#### Root Cause Analysis

The CORS error occurs because:

1. **Server sends redirect to Stripe Checkout URL:**
   - Controller creates `Stripe::Checkout::Session` with URL like `https://pay.ad.nexus/c/pay/cs_live_...`
   - Uses `redirect_to session.url, allow_other_host: true`

2. **Client tries to follow redirect with fetch:**
   - Rails form submission sends request via `fetch` (from Turbo/Hotwire)
   - Browser attempts to follow the Stripe redirect
   - Stripe domain does not include `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:4000`
   - Browser blocks the request due to CORS policy

3. **Why Issue 1 Works But Issue 2 Doesn't:**
   - Issue 1 (`/subscriptions/portal`) uses a standard `link_to` with `method: :get`
   - Browser navigates directly to `/subscriptions/portal` endpoint
   - Server at `/subscriptions/portal` creates Stripe session and redirects
   - Browser performs a top-level navigation (not a fetch request)
   - CORS policies don't apply to top-level navigation
   
   - Issue 2 (`/credits`) uses `form_with` which uses `fetch` by default
   - Turbo intercepts the form submission and uses `fetch` instead of form submission
   - `fetch` is subject to CORS restrictions
   - Stripe domain doesn't include CORS headers for localhost

#### Technical Details

**Controller Code:** `app/controllers/credits_controller.rb` (lines 14-61)
```ruby
def create
  amount = params[:amount].to_f
  # ... validation ...
  
  begin
    # Create Stripe Checkout Session
    session = Stripe::Checkout::Session.create(
      customer: customer_id,
      payment_method_types: ['card'],
      line_items: [{ /* ... */ }],
      mode: 'payment',
      success_url: credits_success_url(amount: amount),
      cancel_url: credits_url,
      # ...
    )
    
    # This redirect fails because fetch is subject to CORS
    redirect_to session.url, allow_other_host: true
  rescue Stripe::StripeError => e
    flash[:error] = "Payment failed: #{e.message}"
    redirect_to credits_path
  end
end
```

**View Code:** `app/views/credits/index.html.erb` (lines 83-129)
```erb
<%= form_with url: credits_path, method: :post, id: 'credits-form', class: 'space-y-5' do |f| %>
  <!-- Form fields -->
  <button
    type="submit"
    id="submit-btn"
    class="w-full px-6 py-3 bg-white text-black rounded-xl font-semibold ...">
    <i class="fa-solid fa-credit-card mr-2"></i>
    <span id="submit-text">Purchase Credits</span>
  </button>
<% end %>
```

**Route Configuration:** `config/routes.rb` (lines 56-58)
```ruby
resources :credits, only: [:index, :create]
get 'credits/new', to: redirect('/credits')
get 'credits/success', to: 'credits#success', as: :credits_success
```

- **After:** `/tmp/billing-test-screenshots/04-credits-after.png` (shows button loading state)

## Solution: Fix Purchase Credits CORS Error

### Recommended Fix

Change the form submission to use a regular HTML form instead of Turbo/Hotwire fetch. This allows the browser to perform a top-level navigation, which bypasses CORS restrictions.

**Option 1: Disable Turbo for the form (SIMPLEST)**

Edit `app/views/credits/index.html.erb` line 83:
```erb
<!-- BEFORE (uses fetch, subject to CORS): -->
<%= form_with url: credits_path, method: :post, id: 'credits-form', class: 'space-y-5' do |f| %>

<!-- AFTER (regular form, bypasses CORS): -->
<%= form_with url: credits_path, method: :post, id: 'credits-form', class: 'space-y-5', local: true, data: { turbo: false } do |f| %>
```

This tells Turbo to skip the form and use standard browser form submission.

**Option 2: Use form_tag instead**

```erb
<form action="<%= credits_path %>" method="post" id="credits-form" class="space-y-5">
  <input type="hidden" name="authenticity_token" value="<%= form_authenticity_token %>">
  <!-- form fields -->
</form>
```

**Option 3: Redirect in JavaScript instead of server**

In the controller, render JSON response instead of redirect:
```ruby
def create
  amount = params[:amount].to_f
  # ... validation and session creation ...
  
  render json: { redirect_url: session.url }
end
```

Then in JavaScript:
```javascript
form.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  const formData = new FormData(this);
  
  fetch(this.action, {
    method: 'POST',
    body: formData,
    headers: { 'X-CSRF-Token': document.querySelector('[name="csrf-token"]').content }
  })
  .then(r => r.json())
  .then(data => {
    window.location.href = data.redirect_url; // Top-level navigation
  });
});
```

### Recommended Solution: Option 1 (Simplest)

**File:** `/Users/z/work/adnexus/dsp/app/views/credits/index.html.erb`

**Change on line 83:**
```erb
<%= form_with url: credits_path, method: :post, id: 'credits-form', class: 'space-y-5', local: true, data: { turbo: false } do |f| %>
```

**Why this works:**
- Tells Turbo NOT to intercept the form submission
- Browser performs standard form POST instead of fetch
- Standard form POST follows redirects without CORS checks
- User is seamlessly redirected to Stripe Checkout

**Impact:**
- ✅ Fixes the CORS error
- ✅ Still works with JavaScript validation
- ✅ No changes needed to controller
- ✅ Page refresh/history navigation works correctly
- ✅ Minimal code change

## Comparison: Why Issue 1 Works

### /subscriptions/portal (Working)

```erb
<%= link_to portal_subscriptions_path, class: 'inline-flex items-center btn btn-primary' do %>
  Manage Payment Methods
<% end %>
```

**Flow:**
1. User clicks `<a>` link
2. Browser navigates to `GET /subscriptions/portal`
3. Controller creates Stripe session and redirects
4. Browser performs top-level navigation to Stripe URL
5. **CORS not checked for top-level navigation**
6. ✅ Works perfectly

### /credits (Broken)

```erb
<%= form_with url: credits_path, method: :post, id: 'credits-form' do |f| %>
```

**Current Flow (Broken):**
1. User clicks submit button
2. Turbo intercepts form and uses `fetch` 
3. `fetch` sends POST to `/credits`
4. Controller creates Stripe session and responds with redirect
5. Turbo/fetch follows redirect to Stripe URL
6. **CORS error - Stripe doesn't allow fetch from localhost**
7. ❌ Fails

**Fixed Flow (with `data: { turbo: false }`):**
1. User clicks submit button
2. Browser submits form normally (no fetch)
3. POST sent to `/credits`
4. Controller creates Stripe session and responds with redirect
5. Browser performs top-level navigation to Stripe
6. **CORS not checked for top-level navigation**
7. ✅ Works

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Required)

1. **Fix Issue 2 - Add `data: { turbo: false }` to credits form**
   - File: `/Users/z/work/adnexus/dsp/app/views/credits/index.html.erb`
   - Line: 83
   - Change: Add `data: { turbo: false }` to form_with
   - Estimated time: 2 minutes
   - Risk: Low (standard Rails practice)

### Testing After Fix

```bash
# 1. Restart Rails server
rails s

# 2. Navigate to http://localhost:4000/credits
# 3. Enter "25" in amount field
# 4. Click "Purchase Credits"
# 5. Verify redirect to Stripe Checkout page
# 6. Check browser console for no CORS errors
```

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Standardize all payment flows** - Ensure all checkout redirects use the same pattern
2. **Add integration tests** - Test Stripe redirect flows in automated tests
3. **Error handling** - Add user-friendly error messages for CORS/network failures
4. **Monitoring** - Track failed checkout attempts in analytics

## Files Analyzed

- `/Users/z/work/adnexus/dsp/app/controllers/subscriptions_controller.rb` - Works correctly
- `/Users/z/work/adnexus/dsp/app/controllers/credits_controller.rb` - Logic correct, view needs fix
- `/Users/z/work/adnexus/dsp/app/views/subscriptions/index.html.erb` - Works correctly
- `/Users/z/work/adnexus/dsp/app/views/credits/index.html.erb` - Needs `turbo: false` added
- `/Users/z/work/adnexus/dsp/config/routes.rb` - Routes configured correctly

---

## Conclusion

**Issue 1 is WORKING as expected.** The Stripe Customer Portal redirect functions correctly.

**Issue 2 has a CORS error due to Turbo form submission.** The fix is simple: disable Turbo for the credits form by adding `data: { turbo: false }` to the form_with helper. This will allow the browser to perform a standard form submission, which bypasses CORS restrictions.

The issue is NOT with the Stripe integration itself, but with how the form submission is being handled by Turbo/Hotwire. Once fixed, both features will work seamlessly.
