## The Fix (One Line Change)

**File:** `/Users/z/work/adnexus/dsp/app/views/credits/index.html.erb`  
**Line:** 83

```erb
<!-- BEFORE (Broken - uses Turbo fetch) -->
<%= form_with url: credits_path, method: :post, id: 'credits-form', class: 'space-y-5' do |f| %>

<!-- AFTER (Fixed - disables Turbo) -->
<%= form_with url: credits_path, method: :post, id: 'credits-form', class: 'space-y-5', local: true, data: { turbo: false } do |f| %>
```

**What Changed:**
- Added `local: true` - Use standard form helper
- Added `data: { turbo: false }` - Disable Turbo interception

**Why It Works:**
- Disables Turbo's fetch interception
- Allows standard browser form submission
- Top-level navigation bypasses CORS
- User successfully redirected to Stripe Checkout

## Deployment Guide

### Risk Assessment
- **Files Modified:** 1
- **Lines Changed:** 1
- **Migrations Needed:** 0
- **Controller Changes:** 0
- **Breaking Changes:** 0
- **Risk Level:** LOW

### Steps to Deploy
1. Review the 1-line code change
2. Restart Rails server
3. Test in browser: http://localhost:4000/credits
4. Verify redirect to Stripe Checkout
5. Check console for no CORS errors

## Technical Deep Dive

### The Problem
```
User clicks "Purchase Credits" button
  ↓
Turbo intercepts form submission
  ↓
Uses fetch API to send POST request
  ↓
fetch is subject to CORS policy
  ↓
Stripe domain doesn't allow fetch from localhost:4000
  ↓
CORS error blocks the request
  ↓
User stuck on /credits page (button appears to hang)
```

### Why Issue 1 Works
```
User clicks "Manage Payment Methods" link
  ↓
Standard <a> tag navigation
  ↓
Browser navigates to /subscriptions/portal
  ↓
Server creates Stripe session and redirects
  ↓
Top-level navigation to Stripe
  ↓
CORS not checked for top-level navigation
  ↓
✅ Works perfectly
```

### The Solution
```
Disable Turbo form interception
  ↓
Use standard HTML form submission
  ↓
POST sent via standard browser form
  ↓
Server creates Stripe session and redirects
  ↓
Browser performs top-level navigation
  ↓
CORS not checked for top-level navigation
  ↓
✅ User redirected to Stripe Checkout successfully
```

## Key Files Modified

| File | Line | Change | Impact |
|------|------|--------|--------|

## Console Errors

### Before Fix
```
CORS Error: Access to fetch at 'https://pay.ad.nexus/c/pay/...' 
  (redirected from 'http://localhost:4000/credits') 
  from origin 'http://localhost:4000' 
  has been blocked by CORS policy

Failed to load resource: net::ERR_FAILED

TypeError: Failed to fetch
```

### After Fix
```
(Only minor warning)
Failed to download or decode a non-empty icon for payment app with 
"https://pay.google.com/gp/p/web_manifest.json" manifest.

Note: This is expected and harmless - it's from Stripe/Google Pay, 
not from our application.
```

## FAQ

**Q: Why does Issue 1 work but Issue 2 doesn't?**  
A: Issue 1 uses a standard link (`link_to`), while Issue 2 uses a form that Turbo intercepts. Turbo converts the form to a fetch request, which is blocked by CORS.

**Q: Is this a Stripe issue?**  
A: No, Stripe is working correctly. The issue is with how Rails Turbo handles form submissions. The fix is on our side.

**Q: Do I need to change the controller?**  
A: No, the controller logic is correct. The fix is only in the view template.

**Q: Is this fix safe?**  
A: Yes, it's a standard Rails pattern. Disabling Turbo for specific forms is common when redirecting to external services.

**Q: Will this break anything?**  
A: No, it only affects the credits purchase form. All other functionality remains unchanged.

**Q: Can I apply this same fix elsewhere?**  
A: Yes, if you have other forms that redirect to external services, apply the same fix.
